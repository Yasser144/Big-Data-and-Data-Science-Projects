Predictive modeling plays a critical role in healthcare by helping medical practitioners make timely decisions based on data-driven insights. In this study, we focus on three key predictive tasks:
1.	Length-of-Stay Prediction (LOS): Predicting the length of a patient's hospital stay, which helps in resource allocation and discharge planning.
2.	Mortality Prediction: Predicting the likelihood of in-hospital mortality, crucial for early intervention and care prioritization.
3.	Readmission Prediction: Predicting the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, assisting in preventing unnecessary readmissions and improving patient care.
These tasks were approached using machine learning models to predict these outcomes based on a variety of clinical and demographic features. The methods used for these tasks included regression models for LOS and classification models for Mortality and Readmission predictions.
